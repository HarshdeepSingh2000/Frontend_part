
To run a website using Visual Studio Code's Live Server extension, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Visual Studio Code
Live Server Extension
Running the Website
Clone the repository to your local machine or create a new folder for your website project.

Place your HTML and CSS files inside the project folder.

Open Visual Studio Code.

Click on "File" in the top-left corner, and then select "Open Folder."

Navigate to the folder containing your website files and select the folder.

In the Visual Studio Code sidebar, you should see the project files (e.g., index.html, style.css).

Right-click on the .html file (or any HTML file you want to run) and select "Open with Live Server." You should see a "Go Live" button in the bottom-right corner of the window.

Click on the "Go Live" button to start the Live Server.

The website should now open in your default web browser. You can interact with the website, and any changes you make to the HTML or CSS files will be automatically updated in the browser without the need to manually refresh the page.

To stop the Live Server, click on the "Stop" button next to the "Go Live" button in the bottom-right corner of the window.

Note: If you have multiple HTML files (e.g., index.html, about.html, etc.) and want to view them, you can right-click on each file and select "Open with Live Server" to see them in your browser.
